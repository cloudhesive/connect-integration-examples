# AWS Connect Integration Examples

Welcome to our AWS Connect Integration Examples repository! Here, we showcase the development of Lambda Functions tailored to automate and optimize the current AWS Connect integrations provided by our esteemed clients. Our primary objective is to streamline development processes, empowering you with pre-implemented functions and well-defined templates for seamless implementation.

## How this repository is organized

You'll find the implementations organized within the following subdirectories:

|     Function    |       Folder      | AWS Service |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|
| Call API       | [callAPI/](src/functions/connect/callAPIFunction)  | AWS Connect        |
| Send Whatsapp message    | [sendWhatsappMessage/](src/functions/connect/sendWhatsappMessageFunction)       | AWS Connect      |

Each directory houses detailed instructions for understanding and invoking the example code. You'll find comprehensive documentation within the README.md file of each folder.
